# Background image quality

The hero background uses **strivonbackgroundimage.png** in this folder.

**To get sharp, good quality (no blur):** replace this file with a **high-resolution** version of the same image.

- **Minimum:** 1920px wide (e.g. 1920×1080)
- **Better:** 2560px wide or 2560×1440 for retina
- **Format:** PNG or JPG, same filename: `strivonbackgroundimage.png`

The site never re-encodes the image. If the file is low resolution (e.g. 800px), the browser has to stretch it to fill the screen and it will look blurry. Using a 1920px+ wide image fixes that.
