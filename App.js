// This App.js file is required when running Expo from the root directory
// IMPORTANT: The app should be run from apps/mobile/ directory for best results
// This file exists only to satisfy Expo's AppEntry.js requirement

// Removed expo-router dynamic loading - run the app from apps/mobile/ directory instead
console.log('Please run the app from apps/mobile/ directory:');
console.log('  cd apps/mobile');
console.log('  npm start');
